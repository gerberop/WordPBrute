WordPress BruteForcer
Yes, yes... I know there are a million wordpress login bruteforcers out there. However, I wanted to learn simple python scripting and start getting myself used to having arguments in my scripts.

USAGE:
Python3 WordPBrute.py:
[*] -U, --users <UserNameFile>
[*] -P, --passwords <PasswordFile>
[*] -H, --HOST <HOST>

That is pretty much it lol.
Use at your own risk :D
